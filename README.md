# Tauri-Revanced

Let's break everything.

## Introduction

**DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT**

I don't know where this one will go yet, i just want to try some really drastic changes i can't do in Tauri itself.

### Platforms

I expect that the supported platforms will end up being different from upstream Tauri at some point so i will keep the support matrix here:

| Platform   | Versions                                   |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Windows    | 10 and above - different from upstream!    |
| macOS      | 10.15 and above                            |
| Linux      | webkit2gtk 4.1 (for example Ubuntu 22.04). |
| iOS/iPadOS | 9 and above                                |
| Android    | 7 and above                                |

## Contributing

Don't.

## MSRV Policy

For now this will require the latest Rust version. At some point it should become n-3.
